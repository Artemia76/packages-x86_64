JWM is configured via an XML configuration file. By default, this file is located in "/usr/etc/system.jwmrc". To customize JWM, copy this file to "$HOME/.jwmrc" and then modify it using your favorite text editor. Although somewhat verbose, XML (which looks much like HTML) provides a convenient way to represent hierarchical configuration, such as menus. In addition, XML fairly easy to edit either by hand or programmatically.
