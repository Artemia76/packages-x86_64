The GRUB bootloader will be installed on the same partition. This article is designed so that you won't have to do too much
thinking. The process is quite straightforward.</td>

then be put on a disc or usb drive, and used to reinstall NuTyX if necessary. If you want, you can add a graphical interface too. It's up to you to add all the packages you want when you install the kernel, which is the minimum required.</td>

bash, this article will explain the basis for writing a <a class="url" href="dictionary.html#ID050">script,</a> without going 
insane.

you need to create a <a class="url" href="dictionary.html#ID060">recipe</a>. This is placed in a <a class="url" href="dictionary.html#ID070">port</a>, which is a directory containing various files needed for building the package. The command <b>pkgmk</b> will produce the package which can then be installed.</td>

    <td width="30%" class="lien_article" ><h3><a class="url" href="build-pre.html">Build your own NuTyX</a></h3></td><td width="70%">This document explains how to build a linux distribution, in this case NuTyX, from scratch. As a basis we will use 
the excellent online manual found in:<a class="url" href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development">http://www.linuxfromscratch.or...ew/development/</a>. <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />This 
article is targeted at people who know what a GNU/linux distribution is. Ideally you should have built LFS entirely by hand 
at least once before trying this method.  <a class="url" href="https://github.com/NuTyX/core/commits/master">This project is continuously in development</a>, so it is possible that you will encounter some errors during the build.</div> The article is divided into four sections:
     <ol>
      <li><a class="url" href="build-pre.html">Preparing for the build</a></li>
      <li><a class="url" href="build-pass-1.html">Building the CHROOT environment (pass 1)</a></li>
      <li><a class="url" href="build-pass-2.html">Building the NuTyX system (pass 2)</a></li>
      <li><a class="url" href="build-post.html">The post-build phase and generation of the iso</a></li>

   <tr class="even">
    <td width="30%" class="lien_article" ><h3><a class="url" href="build-bot.html">Setup a build bot</a></h3></td><td width="70%">This article is addressed particularly to package developers. It explains how you can build all the packages of a 
collection completely automatically with a command as 
simple as: <pre class="command"><kbd>bash bin/enter-nutyx /development/kde5</kbd></pre> It is important to have a good 
understanding of your NuTyX distribution so as to be able to use the script properly.</td>
