  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
   <h2>The installer doesn't allow me to specify a separate /home partition</h2>
    <div><p>This question has been asked many times. I will try to answer it as far as possible.</p></div>
    <div><p>Modern users often have a lot of data on their computers. The size of the home folder can quickly become very large. MP3 files, photos and videos are big files. <p>

Imagine that you have a 250 GB hard disk. You say &quot;OK, I'll take 100 G for the system and 150 for my personal data.&quot; Great! You just cut your disk into two pieces, and the home partition will fill up more quickly in proportion to its size than if you had retained a single partition. It would be nice if we could reinstall NuTyX when we wanted without having to cut the hard disk into separate partitions to preserve personal data. <u>That's exactly how the NuTyX installer works</u>.</p></div>
    <ul>
    <li>The installer will never format a partition that is already formated, without manual intervention.</li>
    <li>If you have a distribution (NuTyX or any other) with personal data and the system on the same partition, the installer will tell you during the installation process that there is already a distribution there but will not offer to format the partition. You will need to delete the <b>  /var, /proc, /sys, /usr, /sbin,</b> and <b>/etc </b> folders, but other folders such as <b>/home</b> and <b>/MP3</b>  will not be touched. So your data are safe.</li> 
   <li>Today it is very easy to configure a file server based on NFS, so that users could have their home folders on a remote server.</li>
    <li>To summarise: creating a separate home partition today is unecessary, at least with NuTyX. It's worth asking why Apple's MacOS operating system never recommended this.</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Is it possible to upgrade NuTyX (prior to 8.0) to NuTyX 8.1 without reinstalling everything?</h2>
    <div><p>No. The number of changes is too great. The package manager has changed, the initrd has changed, the installer has changed, and the ports location has changed.</p></div>
