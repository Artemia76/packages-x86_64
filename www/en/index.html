  <h1>Welcome</h1>
           <p>I am the Chief Administrator of the NuTyX System. My home language is French however, I also speak and understand English. NuTyX is a complete GNU/Linux distribution incorporating performance and flexibility, it is based on the Linux From Scratch books <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/">LFS</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/">BLFS</a>. We recommend to have some knowledge about the GNU/Linux system. NuTyX is an excellent operating system for persons who want to commit themselves in  developing their skills further and learn how a linux system is fused together. NuTyX is a binary distribution  optimized for  architectures i686 and x86_64. It is up to you in deciding wheter to use the ports system of  installing your own source packages - which requires compiling or be content with the binary packages that are natively integrated into the system. NuTyX offer the XFCE graphical interface in binary.</p>
           <h2>The 10 advantages of NuTyX</h2>
	    <ol>
		<li>The ability to be installed from almost any other distribution, thanks to the BASH script located at http://downloads.nutyx.org/install-saravane. this can be downloaded, check and then launch from the host distribution. It will check for all necessary toos, then start the download of a minimal set of packages and finally, install them in the location you specified. Details and explanations are found in http://www.nutyx.org/en/generate-iso.html.</li>
		<li>It has a Maintenance program which allows you full access to rectify your system in cases of complete system failure. The NuTyX maintenance program has ability to able to erase, format, modify (as the file system is not mounted) partition, and also re-install the system and the Grub boot-loader.</li>
		<li>It has the ability of using a very simple syntax program that uses a method called <b>porting</b> which downloads a package/s from our repositories. The program is very similay to the one used by CRUX, it can be written  in less then 10 lines. It can also sort and apply all Dependencies if needed. Instead of the script, you can also use the binary package manager to download and install your Personnal packages.</li>
		<li>It has the ability, once installed to easily alter and produce a personalized live version of NuTyX. The new live version can also be re-install on other machines, should you so desire. You can find some versions of live NuTyX on <a class="url" href="http://www.freetorrent.fr">the website of freetorrent.fr</a></li>
                <li>It has the ability, to allow you installation of a complete base binary package or a selection of individual base binary packages. For example: devel, man, doc and lib.</li>
                <li>It has no need of a separate HDD or partition. The NuTyX installer create a virtual environment and therefore is able to install/re-install without formatting the target disk or partition.</li>
                <li>It has unique installation code, that disallows the NuTyX installer to FORMAT the target partition. This means that NuTyX can be installed on a partition containing data: (for example) personnal files, various non-system folders.</li>
                <li>It has a very powerful, yet A simple command which allow you to return to the base system and change completely the X graphical interface (from KDE to XFCE). This also allow you not having to reinstall or download every packages again. The downloaded packages and updates will be simply be reinstalled automatically.</li>
                <li>It has a totally unique package manager for the needs of NuTyX. It's made of expandable modules. No dependencies (beside glibc) are needed. One of its strong points is the ability to discover binary dependencies automatically.</li>
                <li>It has the ability to compile all the packages properly per level on a dedicated chroot environment. After compilation, all the dependencies are again checked to make sure no broken links are found.</li>
               </ol>
	  <p>NuTyX offer the KDE and XFCE graphical interfaces in binaries.
