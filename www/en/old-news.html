   <h2>NuTyX houaphan 8.1 available with cards 2.0</h2>
    <h3>Introduction for the impatient</h3>
     <p>Six months after the first houaphan <b>8.0</b> version release, I am proud to announce the release of NuTyX 8.1.

     <p>You can consult the <a href="packages.html">Packages list</a> page for a complete list of available packages.</p>
    <h3>Upgrade from 8.0</h3>
     <p>An upgrade is possibible: from the 8.0 version it is possible to do it without reinstalling everything.</p>
     <p>It is absolutly necessary to be in 'none graphic mode' to make the update so we stop the graphical interface server:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>init 3</kbd></pre>
     <p>It's higly recommended to have a wired connection and start the upgrade after a:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards base -r</kbd></pre>
     <p>command. Once you're done and ready, you just have to tell <b>cards</b> to switch from version <i>8.0</i> to <i>8.1</i></p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>echo "name houaphan
version 8.1" &gt; /var/lib/pkg/nutyx-version</kbd></pre>
     <p>You are now ready to finalise the upgrade:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync
cards install -u cards
cards install -u nutyx
reboot</kbd></pre>
     <p>Before the reboot process, your NuTyX will download all the base packages and upgrade them, when your machine is up again, you will be under the<b>NuTyX houaphan 8.1</b> version.</p>
     <p>Last is to setup the proper locales again:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>setup-nutyx -cl</kbd></pre>
     <p>You will reconnize the screen, choose your locale and you are done. You can now install what ever you like for a normal installation explained in the next chapter</p>
    <h3>Install 8.1</h3>
     <p>It has to be noted that all available graphic interfaces are accessible from the versatile connection manager <b>lxdm</b>, so remember to add it (and xorg) in your packages list whatever interface you choose to install.</p>
     <p>An example of an installation with all the availables packages of gnome will therefore look like:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>check
get xorg gnome gnome-extra lxdm</kbd></pre>
     <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />Even if the <b>gdm</b> package is include in the <b>gnome</b> collection, it is not possible to connect yourself via it. But it has to be installed to make gnome work properly..</div>
     <p>To install the xfce graphical interface, we will simply replace gnome with xfce4</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>check
get xorg xfce4 xfce4-extra lxdm</kbd></pre>
     <p>If this is a new installation, remember to create at least one user with the command:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>nu</kbd></pre>
     <p>And finaly reboot your machine before trying anything else (it's the easiest way).</p>
    <h3>The news graphical interfaces</h3>
     <p>With houaphan 8.1 version, following graphical interfaces <b>kde5</b>, <b>gnome</b>, <b>mate</b>, <b>lxde</b>, <b>xfce4</b>, <b>openbox</b> are now  available in binaries.</p>
     <p>If you want to install another graphical interface you will need to compile it.</p>
    <h3>The new <b>2.0</b> cards features</h3>
     <p>Cards in <b>2.0</b> version can now make a full upgrade of your installation.
     A lot of internal reorganisation in the code to make cards more easy to maintain. You can always consult <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/cards/commits/master">the changelog.</a></p>
     <p>Together with the new NuTyX 8.1 startup script, <b>cards</b> is now able to make upgrades on its own. If there are some available upgrades, at the shutdown of the computer, <b>cards</b> will downloads and upgrade obsolet versions of your binaries.</p>
     <p>This new cards version include a API library which will give the possibility to create an "easy" graphical interface. This graphical interface will depends on the <b>libcards</b> library only.</p>
     <p>To be able to reuse (partially) existings ARCH-Linux recipes, new variables are now recognised, the <b>3</b> different valid Pkgfiles show possible variables:</p>

     <p>A big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/peter1000">peter1000</a> who made a big work of investigation, and track down a lot of bugs. We had the chance to exchange a lot of experience. peter1000 even started his own fork of cards.</p>
     <p><a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/cards/blob/master/scripts/pkgmk2.in">peter1000</a> has start a pkgmk2 script with support of colors, NLS support, more source formats like git, bazard, svn etc. You are welcome to test this new script.</p>
    <h3>The difference between a &lt;nnn&gt; collection and a  &lt;nnn-extra&gt; collection</h3>
     <p>There is a difference between, for example, the collection <b>'cli'</b> and <b>'cli-extra'</b>: The ports and binary in the collection <b><i>'cli'</i></b> are almost frozen in their version at the time of the release of NuTyX version, while ports and binary collections <b><i>-extra</i> </b> can be updated at any time.</p>
     <p>This technique isolates the <b>'central system'</b> (ie collections <b><i>'base'</i></b>, <b><i>'cli'</i></b> and <b><i>'gui'</i></b>) updates that may be on the <i>"peripheral"</i> applications contained in <b><i>-extra </i></b> collections.</p>
     <p>Therefore, applications found in the <b><i>'base-extra' </i></b>, <b><i> 'cli-extra' </i></b> or <b><i>'gui-extra'</i></b> collections are completely independent from the <b>'central system'</b>, technically it means no dependence of the central system 'must s find there.</p>
    <h3>The new installation script</h3>
     <p>The <b>bash</b> script <a href="http://downloads.nutyx.org/install-nutyx">install-nutyx</a> works now as a real application. It has the following options:</p>
     <li>Intall NuTyX in a folder
      <pre class="command"><kbd>LFS=/mnt/lfs bash install-nutyx</kbd></pre>
<p>The script will analyse the <b>/etc/install-nutyx.conf</b> file if it exist and contains the following define variables, they are at the moment 4 configurables variables: the installation path define by the <b>LFS</b> variable, the url adress of the mirror where are the binaries located via the <b>URL</b> variable, the version to installed (8.1, stable or current) define by the <b>VERSION</b> variable and finaly the <b>local</b> path of the downloaded binaries define by the <b>DEPOT</b> variable. Here is a summary example of the <b>/etc/install-nutyx.conf</b> file:</p>
     <pre class="output">URL="http://localhost"
DEPOT="/DEPOT"
LFS="/mnt/lfs"
VERSION="current"</pre>
</li>
     <p>At the moment the <b>VERSION</b> variable can have 3 values: "current", "stable" or "8.1" which is, by the way the one by default.</p>
    <li>Using the configuration files located in the  <b>/etc/install-nutyx.conf.d/</b> folder when NuTyX is installed, here is the list:

   <h2>NuTyX houaphan 8.0 available with cards 1.3.3</h2>
    <h3>Introduction for the impatient</h3>
     <p>Eleven months after the <b>Saravane 14.11</b> version release and five months after the release of the <b>15.05 Saravane</b>, I am proud to announce the release of NuTyX. His code name is <b>Houaphan</b>. The first version available is in <b>8.0</b>. Why that number? Time passes very quickly, <b>Houaphan</b> is already the 8th major release since the first public version of NuTyX ie in 2007. The following summarizes several new packages: 
      <ul>
       <li>glibc 2.22</li>
       <li>gcc 5.2.0</li>
       <li>kernel 4.2.0</li>

      </ul>
     <p>It has to be noted that all available graphic interfaces are accessible from the versatile connection manager <b>lxdm</b>, so remember to add it (and xorg) in your packages list whatever interface you choose to install.</p>
     <p>An example of an installation with all the availables packages of gnome will therefore look like:</p>

     <p>And finaly reboot your machine before trying anything else (it's the easiest way).</p>
    <h3>The news graphical interfaces</h3>
     <p>With houaphan version, graphical interfaces <b>kde5</b>, <b>gnome</b>, <b>mate</b>, <b>lxde</b>, <b>lxqt</b> are now also available.</p>
    <h3>The new 1.3.x cards features</h3>
     <p>Cards in <b>1.3.3</b> version can install one or more packages, one or more collections, or a mixture of packages and collections. If a package and a collection have the same name, it will be the package (and its dependencies) that will be installed.</p>
     <p>You don't have to specify the architecture of your machine in the cards configuration file. In addition, the URL specifying the download mirror is now made simple.</p>
     <p>In a package research now also shows the result of the collection or package (s) found (s).</p>
     <p>The new configuration format is now easier as shown in the example below:</p>
      <pre class="output">dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/gui|http://downloads.nutyx.org
dir /var/lib/pkg/depot/xfce4-extra|http://downloads.nutyx.org

    <h3>The difference between a &lt;nnn&gt; collection and a  &lt;nnn-extra&gt; collection</h3>
     <p>There is a difference between, for example, the collection <b>'cli'</b> and <b>'cli-extra'</b>: The ports and binary in the collection <b><i>'cli'</i></b> are almost frozen in their version at the time of the release of NuTyX version, while ports and binary collections <b><i>-extra</i> </b> can be updated at any time.</p>
     <p>This technique isolates the <b>'central system'</b> (ie collections <b><i>'base'</i></b>, <b><i>'cli'</i></b> and <b><i>'gui'</i></b>) updates that may be on the <i>"peripheral"</i> applications contained in <b><i>-extra </i></b> collections.</p>
     <p>Therefore, applications found in the <b><i>'base-extra' </i></b>, <b><i> 'cli-extra' </i></b> or <b><i>'gui-extra'</i></b> collections are completely independent from the <b>'central system'</b>, technically it means no dependence of the central system 'must s find there.</p>
    <h3>The new installation script</h3>
     <p>The <b>bash</b> script <a href="http://downloads.nutyx.org/install-houaphan">install-houaphan</a> works now as a real application. It has the following options:</p>
     <li>Intall NuTyX in a folder
      <pre class="command"><kbd>bash install-houaphan -p /mnt/lfs</kbd></pre>
<p>The script will analyse the contents of the <b>/etc/install-houphan.conf</b> if it exist and contains the following define variables, they are at the moment 4 configurables variables: the installation path define by the <b>LFS</b> variable, the url adress of the mirror where are the binaries located via the <b>URL</b> variable, the version to installed (8.0 or current) define by the <b>VERSION</b> variable and finaly the <b>local</b> path of the downloaded binaries define by the <b>DEPOT</b> variable. Here is a summary example of the <b>/etc/install-houphan.conf</b> file:</p>
     <pre class="output">URL="http://192.168.254.254"
DEPOT="/houaphan"
LFS="/mnt/lfs"
VERSION="current"</pre>
</li> 
     <p>At the moment the <b>VERSION</b> variable can have 2 values: "current" ou "8.0" which is, by the way the one by default.</p>
    <li>Using the configuration files located in the  <b>/etc/install-houphan.conf.d/</b> folder when NuTyX is installed, here is the list:

   <h3>The github website and the different projects</h3>
     <p>You can find all the recipes, the installer code, the site, the documentation on the website <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX">github</a></p>
   <h3>The construction of NuTyX</h3>
     <p>The construction method is now based on sources available at <a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/houaphan">https://github.com/NuTyX/houaphan</a></p>
     <p>The NuTyX construction thus follows the commits on the current branch of houaphan</p>
     <p>To ensure the disponibily of the sources of all the packages need for a basic system, they are now available at <a href="http://downloads.nutyx.org/current/sources">http://downloads.nutyx.org/current/sources</a> sources.</p>
   <h3>The renaming of some packages</h3>
    <p>Over time, many packages (especially libraries) offers several versions of the same installable package sets (qt, gtk, etc.) some time we must be consistent in  the names of thoseslibraries.</p>
   <h3>The 32 bits version</h3>
    <p>For this new version of NuTyX, the 32-bit version is proposed as a base system, the user may wish to compile himself packages that he wants to use.</p>

   <h2>NuTyX Saravane 15.05 includes cards 1.0</h2>
    <h3>Introduction for the impatient</h3>
     <p>After seven months of intensive programming, I am proud to announce the release of  NuTyX Saravane 15.05, which replaces the previous Saravane 14.11 release. Below is a summary of the new features:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>glibc 2.21</li>
       <li>gcc 4.9.2</li>
       <li>binutils 2.25</li>
       <li>kernel 3.19.6</li>
       <li>kernel-lts 3.18.12</li>
       <li>kernel-iso 3.18.11</li>
       <li>cards 1.0</li>
       <li>curl 7.42.1</li>
       <li>firefox 37.0.2</li>
       <li>A convenient command line configuration tool (setup-nutyx) for the clock, keyboard, network and language</li>
       <li>Ready to use <b>User Graphic Interface</b> for easy installation and simple auto log-in: KDE 4.14.3 and 4.10.1 Xfce4</li>
       <li>New NuTyX ISO 15.05 images for 32 and 64 architectures</li>
       <li>Finally, a New completely revised version of <b>cards 1.0</b> is available</li>
       <li>Documentation is completed on the web site</li>
       <li>Includes installation script of NuTyX Saravane</li>
       <li>The complete project is available at https://github.com/NuTyX</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For full update packages, you can visit:<a href="https://github.com/NuTyX/saravane/commits/master">https://github.com/NuTyX/saravane/commits/master</a></p>
     <h3>The ISO</h3>
      <p>If the dedicated partitioning attributes was finalized prior to installation, then you will simply only need to choose “install” from the main menu.</p>
      <p>The installation of the boot process has also been simplified: If you prefer to install the GRUB <u>BEFORE</u> installing NuTyX, you are still able to choose a NuTyX destination partition after setting up GRUB. If you prefer to install NuTyX immediately and install GRUB later at the end, GRUB will be automatically installed on your NuTyX partition.</p>
      <p>The kernel used is a 3.19.6. An LTS (Long term support) release is also available in Version 3.18.12.</p>
      <p>The ISO is now 100% translated in the following languages: Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Norwegian and Swedish.</p>
      <p>The file system <b>jfs</b> has also been included as a possible choice. Although endorsed by Red-Hat, <b>jfs</b> may run into copyright issues later on, as it was created by IBM. For performance, there is <b>btrfs</b>, for stability and control there is <b>xfs</b>.</p>
      <p>If you want to install NuTyX on a partition formatted with btrfs (dev/sda2 for exemple), you <u>must</u> create another partition for grub (/dev/sda1 for exemple). For more clarity <b>/dev/sda1</b> will be formatted as <b>ext2</b>, and house GRUB. While <b>/dev/sda2</b> will be formatted as <b>btrfs</b> and house your NuTyX.</p>
     <h3>The installation script</h3>
     <p>It is now very easy and possible to install NuTyX from <u>any distribution</u>. The past problems with the <b>BASH</b> interpreter has now been resolved.</p>
     <p>Two variables are good to know:</p>
     <pre class="output">LFS
URL</pre>
     <p>The <b>LFS</b> variable give the possibility to choose a destination folder. Once defined and "exported", the installation command gets simple as:</p>
     <pre class="output">bash install-saravane</pre>
     <p>The <b>URL</b> allows you to define a personal mirror. Once the installation is finish, the <b>cards</b> command will continue to use this mirror.</p>
    <h3>The web site</h3>
     <p>All articles have been updated for the new functionalities of the package manager <b>cards 1.0</b>.</p>
     <p>The article on <b>"building a package"</b> has been completely reviewed. It explains in detail what's a scenario under NuTyX, what's a collection, the dependencies for compilation, the configuration for each scenario, etc.</p>
     <p>An article about <b>"configuring a firewall"</b> has been written by a user of NuTyX, <b>sh4d0w</b> I warmly thank him. I encourage all users to provide and submit their own. If your article is complete and correct, it will be added to our site.</p>
    <h3>The source code of Saravane is available on github.com/NuTyX, as well a bug tracker. </h3>
     <p>You can find all of my work on NuTyX at: https://github.com/NuTyX, you will find the source code of the following list: cards, ports collection base, console and desktop of Saravane, the scripts, the pass 1 and 2 for the NuTyX construction, the files structure that constitutes the basic system NuTyX (the package aaabasicfs), the initrd, the installer and all the html  
pages from the web site. There are also ports from the collection "extra".</p>
     <p>It is very easy now to monitor NuTyX, you can instantly submit your wishes and bugs on github platform.</p>
    <h3>The cards package manager is finaly release in 1.0 version</h3>
     <p>In its final version, <b>cards</b> is now even faster and easier to use. The most common commands have been simplified:</p>
     <p>To synchronise information with the default mirror:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync</kbd></pre>
     <p>To know the installed packages:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards list</kbd></pre>
     <p>For details of an installed package:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards info &lt;name_of_my_package&gt;</kbd></pre>
     <p>To check the obsolete list of installed packages:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards diff</kbd></pre>
     <p>For detail of the cards command:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>man cards</kbd></pre>
     <p>Some new cards commands:</p>
     <pre class="command"><kbd>cards query
cards files
cards help
cards purge
cards depcreate</kbd></pre>
     <p>As for the packager, new variables have been added:</p>
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_LOCALES</pre>
     <p>Default value:</p>
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_LOCALES=(fr)</pre>
     <p>Define the locales that we want to keep in the binary, example: PKGMK_LOCALES=(fr nl) will conserve the french and italians locales (if they were available at compile time) in the sub packages <b>&lt;name_package&gt;.fr and &lt;name_package&gt;.it</b></p>
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_IGNORE_REPO</pre>
     <p>Default value:</p>
     <pre class="output">PKGMK_IGNORE_REPO="yes"</pre>
     <p>If set as <b>"no"</b>, the file <b>.PKGREPO</b> of the collection (means the name of the parent folder of your package) will be regenerated. This file is needed if you wish to installed some packages outside of your chroot</p>

  <h1>On the 2015-04-18</h1>
   <h2>cards 0.10.90 available</h2>
    <p>The <b>cards</b> tool has been completely re-worked. The synchronisation now takes a few seconds. The separation between binaries and ports is a lot clearer.</p>
    <p>News commands added:</p>

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards purge</kbd></pre>
flush old binaries and other obsolets files.

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards help <file></kbd></pre>
provide an help about cards.

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards depcreate</kbd></pre>
Compile a port and its dépendencies in the right order. Similar to the <b>prt-get</b> and <b>depinst</b> commands.

<p>Additional man command: <b>man cards</b> and <b>man cards.conf</b></p>

<p>Note: Following commands altered:</p>

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync -i
cards list -i
cards info -i <paquet>
cards diff -b</kbd></pre>

Are now more streamlined and becomes:

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync
cards list
cards info <paquet>
cards diff</kbd></pre>

   <h2>Updated the documentation on the site</h2>
    <p>Articles <a href="recept.html">What's a port</a>, <a href="build-package.html">How to build a package</a>, <a href="generate-iso.html">Produce a customised ISO</a> are review.</p>
    <h2>New kernels</h2>
    <p>A new <b>kernel</b> is now available, we have migrated to the improved and more stable version 3.19.4, thus removing all problematic incidences.</p>
    <p>A new long term support kernel 3.18 is also available. It can be installed in parallel on the standard kernel. It has just two links to adjust in the boot folder. (initrd and kernel)</p>
    <h2>Next ISO</h2>
    <p>The openssh service will not be implemented in the ISO anymore for security reasons. Hackers could connect remotely if the password was too weak. Even more so when the router is not doing it's firewall job.</p>
    <p>We have a new article explaining how to create easilly your own ISO for distribution.</p>

    <h2>The installation script install-saravane is once again available</h2>
    <p><b>install-saravane</b> is working again. Be aware there are no kernel installed. It checks the minimum requirements: uptodate bash, gawk and wget</p>
    <h2>Halting  prt-get / pkgutils support</h2>
    <p>Support of <b>cards</b> and <b>prt-get/pkgutils</b> in parallel has been halted permanently. The ports of crux are compatible with <b>cards</b> but not the other way around. Under NuTyX, we keep the doc, we keep man pages devel in separates sub packages. If we use the ports of NuTyX with <b>pkgutils</b>, we quickly end up with big packages (kernel for ex ) and then the DB of <b>pkgutils</b> get saturated which make <b>pkgutils</b> very slow.</p>
    <p>The other problem encountered was that the pre-install an post-install are not names similar under <b>cards</b> and <b>pkgutils</b>, under <b>pkgutils</b>, they are named <b>pre-install</b> and <b>post-install</b>. Under <b>cards</b>, they are named <b>&lt;name_of_the_package&gt;.pre-install</b> or <b>&lt;name_of_the_package&gt;.post-install</b>.</p>
    <h2>News sections</h2>
    <p>Section  system becomes base</p>
    <p>Section  server becomes console</p>
    <p>Section  desktop stays desktop</p>
  <h1>On the 2015-03-16</h1>
   <h2>New 32bits and 64 bits iso available</h2>
    <p>I'm pleased to make available new 32 bits and 64 bits ISO. Click on following down-loadable links :</p>
    <a href="http://download.nutyx.org/NuTyX_x86_64-saravane-20150315.iso">In 64 bits</a> and <a href="http://download.nutyx.org/NuTyX_i686-saravane-20150315.iso">in 32 bits</a>
    <p>The installer is made even more simple. From now on if you pre-configure and format the destination partition before launching the installer, the CD <a href="http://nutyx.org/en/install.html#4">ask no questions and the installation will start immediatly</a>within 15 seconds max</p>
    <p>Openssh service is available from the moment you have installed the base. It means you can connect from a terminal from the host machine if you did an installation in virtualbox (with the network configured as bridge). Also very usefull if you have two PC's on the network</p>
    <p><b>Wifi</b> should works again after xcfe4 / kde installation</p>
    <p>About the package:</p>

<li>kernel 3.19.1-NuTyX</li>
