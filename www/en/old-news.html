  <h1>On the 2015-04-18</h1>
   <h2>cards 0.10.90 available</h2>
    <p>The <b>cards</b> tool has been completely re-worked. The synchronisation now takes a few seconds. The separation between binaries and ports is a lot clearer.</p>
    <p>News commands added:</p>

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards purge</kbd></pre>
flush old binaries and other obsolets files.

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards help <file></kbd></pre>
provide an help about cards.

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards depcreate</kbd></pre>
Compile a port and its d√©pendencies in the right order. Similar to the <b>prt-get</b> and <b>depinst</b> commands.

<p>Additional man command: <b>man cards</b> and <b>man cards.conf</b></p>

<p>Note: Following commands altered:</p>

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync -i
cards list -i
cards info -i <paquet>
cards diff -b</kbd></pre>

Are now more streamlined and becomes:

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync
cards list
cards info <paquet>
cards diff</kbd></pre>

   <h2>Updated the documentation on the site</h2>
    <p>Articles <a href="recept.html">What's a port</a>, <a href="build-package.html">How to build a package</a>, <a href="generate-iso.html">Produce a customised ISO</a> are review.</p>
    <h2>New kernels</h2>
    <p>A new <b>kernel</b> is now available, we have migrated to the improved and more stable version 3.19.4, thus removing all problematic incidences.</p>
    <p>A new long term support kernel 3.18 is also available. It can be installed in parallel on the standard kernel. It has just two links to adjust in the boot folder. (initrd and kernel)</p>
    <h2>Next ISO</h2>
    <p>The openssh service will not be implemented in the ISO anymore for security reasons. Hackers could connect remotely if the password was too weak. Even more so when the router is not doing it's firewall job.</p>
    <p>We have a new article explaining how to create easilly your own ISO for distribution.</p>

    <h2>The installation script install-saravane is once again available</h2>
    <p><b>install-saravane</b> is working again. Be aware there are no kernel installed. It checks the minimum requirements: uptodate bash, gawk and wget</p>
    <h2>Halting  prt-get / pkgutils support</h2>
    <p>Support of <b>cards</b> and <b>prt-get/pkgutils</b> in parallel has been halted permanently. The ports of crux are compatible with <b>cards</b> but not the other way around. Under NuTyX, we keep the doc, we keep man pages devel in separates sub packages. If we use the ports of NuTyX with <b>pkgutils</b>, we quickly end up with big packages (kernel for ex ) and then the DB of <b>pkgutils</b> get saturated which make <b>pkgutils</b> very slow.</p>
    <p>The other problem encountered was that the pre-install an post-install are not names similar under <b>cards</b> and <b>pkgutils</b>, under <b>pkgutils</b>, they are named <b>pre-install</b> and <b>post-install</b>. Under <b>cards</b>, they are named <b>&lt;name_of_the_package&gt;.pre-install</b> or <b>&lt;name_of_the_package&gt;.post-install</b>.</p>
    <h2>News sections</h2>
    <p>Section  system becomes base</p>
    <p>Section  server becomes console</p>
    <p>Section  desktop stays desktop</p>
  <h1>On the 2015-03-16</h1>
   <h2>New 32bits and 64 bits iso available</h2>
    <p>I'm pleased to make available new 32 bits and 64 bits ISO. Click on following down-loadable links :</p>
    <a href="http://download.nutyx.org/NuTyX_x86_64-saravane-20150315.iso">In 64 bits</a> and <a href="http://download.nutyx.org/NuTyX_i686-saravane-20150315.iso">in 32 bits</a>
    <p>The installer is made even more simple. From now on if you pre-configure and format the destination partition before launching the installer, the CD <a href="http://nutyx.org/en/install.html#4">ask no questions and the installation will start immediatly</a>within 15 seconds max</p>
    <p>Openssh service is available from the moment you have installed the base. It means you can connect from a terminal from the host machine if you did an installation in virtualbox (with the network configured as bridge). Also very usefull if you have two PC's on the network</p>
    <p><b>Wifi</b> should works again after xcfe4 / kde installation</p>
    <p>About the package:</p>

<li>kernel 3.19.1-NuTyX</li>
<li>initrd 3.19.1-NuTyX</li>
<li>glibc 2.21</li>
<li>gcc 4.9.2</li>
<li>binutils 2.25</li>
<li>cards 0.10.82.96a</li>
<li>curl 7.41.0</li>
<li>openssh 6.7p1</li>
<li>openssl  1.0.2</li>
    <p>New commands:</p>

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards files <package></kbd></pre>
list the file(s) of the package.

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards query <file></kbd></pre>
list owner(s) of file(s) matching the query

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards install <file></kbd></pre>
Can install a file if available on the pc. The file must be a valid downloaded package. The name is irrelevant, cards will check it before install it.

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards install -f &lt;paquet&gt; | &lt;file&gt;</kbd></pre>
Force installation in case of duplicate files

<p><b>Final reminder:</b></p>
<p>The Commands:</p>

<pre class="command"><kbd>cards sync -i
cards list -i
cards info -i <paquet>
cards diff -b</kbd></pre>
